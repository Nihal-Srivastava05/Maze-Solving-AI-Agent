    "This is the first agent I have made which is a simple reflex agent. It follows basic instruction and tries to solves a given maze but does not necessarily succeed at it as it can get get in brances which are terminal (i.e do not go to the goal, just stop) as it might get stuck in loops at that point. But this agent gives us a good idea of how we will be modelling a agent in general and will make things clearer on why I planned to add certain things in next agent."
