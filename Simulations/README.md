For a better visual representation of the agent in the maze I have made a GUI representation of the agent moving in the maze according to the agent. To achieve this, I have used 
pygame library. To use this on your device you will need to install the library which can be done using the below steps:
- If you prefer  to create an environment for the project you can (Not necessary as we only need one library)
- For windows, open command prompt (or anaconda prompt if you use conda) and type `pip install pygame`
- For more details according your respective OS visit: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Once you have it installed on your device go open the python file you want to see and run the file. A new window will appear and you can see the agent run.

Few examples of how it will look like:

As we can see the red square is the agent and the black squares are walls. White lines are basically free spaces which the agent can move on and its goal is to reach the other end.
