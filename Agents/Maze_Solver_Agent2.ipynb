Here we scan the environment and see all directions. Next we collect all possible movements in a list and remove the opposite of the previous move from it (Ex: If we moved up before remove down vice vera) and select a random move from the remaining list. This will help us to avoid getting stuck in consant up and down or left right motion but will cause one problem I will explain in the end."
